Created by James Rohloff

## Problem Statement

Marketing would like to increase email campaign engagement by segmenting
the customer-base using their buying habbits.

## Solution Summary

The data science team has identified 4 customer segments. The 4 customer
segments were given descriptions based on the customer’s top product
purchases.

1.  **Segment 1 Preferences:** Road Bikes, Above \$3,200 (Premium
    Models)

2.  **Segment 2 Preferences:** Road Bikes, Below \$3,200 (Economical
    Models)

3.  **Segment 3 Preferences:** Mountain Bikes, Above \$3,200 (Premium
    Models)

4.  **Segment 4 Preferences:** Both Mountain and Road, Below \$3,200
    (Economical Models)

## Customer Preferences

### Heat Map

Our customer-base consists of 30 bike shops. Several customers have
purchasing preferences for Road or Mountain Bikes based on the
proportion of bikes purchased by category_1 and category_2.
