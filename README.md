# Business-Science-University-Projects

This repository contains files for two projects I completed while taking courses with Business Science University.

## Project 1: Product Pricing Algorithm

The goal of this project was to identify new product ideas and pricing based on the company's existing fleet of bikes. Key steps in this project include:

- Data wrangling to prepare the dataset.
- Development of functions for separating, extracting, and visualizing various bike features.
- Gap analysis to identify areas of opportunity.
- Model creation and evaluation.
- Introduction of two new bike models with recommended prices.

You can view the final project summary in the [product_pricing_algorithm.md](product_pricing_algorithm.md) file.

## Project 2: Customer Segmentation

The goal of this project was to segment the customer base based on their buying habits. Key steps in this project include:

- Creation of functions to identify key customer segments.
- Implementation of K-Means Clustering for customer segmentation.
- Visualization of customer preferences through a heatmap, 2D projection, and violin plots.
- Insights into each segment's buying preferences.

You can access the final project summary in the [customer_segmentation.md](customer_segmentation.md) file.
